# TechArtMajorProject

If you have ever had a great idea come to you in the shower, while on a walk or in a dream, you can testify to the power of giving ourselves time to let the mind wander.   This work invites viewers to consider the pause: a momentary meditation that draws our attention away from the neverending “to-do” list in our minds and acknowledge the progress we have already made. As the viewer sits, the work reacts and responds to their presence: the lights come on in sequence and fill up the apple.   Challenging viewers to consider how a constructed environment can provide brief moments for introspection, this man-made tree does not attempt to recreate a natural environment, but rather works to highlight the calming feeling that is provided by being immersed amongst soft light and draped branches. Drawing inspiration from the story of Sir Isaac Newton and the falling apple that gave him the idea to formulate his theory of gravitation, Pause gives viewers the opportunity to sit, meditate and reflect. Perhaps this work will provide a space for your own “ah ha!” moment to occur.
